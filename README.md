## Prototype Pattern
This type of design pattern is used to instantiate a new object by cloning an existing object called prototype.

## Factory Method Pattern
It is the most commonly used design pattern. Basically, it just abstracts the creation of an object.

## Abstract Factory Pattern
This design pattern provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. They are often implemented with Factory Method pattern.

## Builder Pattern
This design pattern separate the process of creation of objects from its actual usage.

## Singleton Design Pattern
In swift we define Singleton classes by using the static keyword. It means that the object is going to be instantiated only once. Static properties are lazy initialized and will not be instantiated until called.
There is only one copy of this object and is used by the other objects globally.
